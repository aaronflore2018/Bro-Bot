Hello! Here are the commands that I follow by, just make sure to call me 
daddy ;)

1. +choose : A command that randomizes your choices into a desicion based 
on God's opinion. To start, start the message with the command then give 
your choices with the '|' seperator. God will then determine the desicion 
and the result will come out of my mouth.

2. +francothicc : A command that reminds a certain person that thier rump 
is beautiful.

3. +downbad : For when you're just feeling down bad and you need to look 
at cute girls for comfort.

4. +quote : For when a friend says something so stupid that you just have 
to put it in the history books. If you want to quote someone, just start 
with the command, followed by the name in reference, and then the quote itself. 
Make sure the quote is surrounded by quotation marks when you type it in, 
otherwise it will not work. The names that you use are case sensitive, 
so make sure to keep everything the same. 
Example: " +quote Aaron 'its all according to umm... keikaku' "

5. +qlist : An easy way to see the hall of fame for a specific person. 
Just type the command, then the person you want to look up. Names are case 
sensitive. Example: " +qlist Aaron "

6. +randq : Pull up a random quote from someone just to serve them. Just 
type the command, then the person you want to look up. Names are case sensitive. 
Example: " +randq Aaron "

7. +mememute : Would it be funny to mute this perosn at a very specific 
moment, just for the memes? mememute has you covered. Just type the command 
and then the persons name in the server, then watch them be muted for a full 
15 seconds. Enough to be funny for you but enough to not be annoying for them.
